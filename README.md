It's time we all entered the 21st century and left behind those old-fashioned laundry boards. With my system, you can easily book and cancel laundry times from anywhere.

My ultimate goal is to add a notification feature that sends you a reminder when your laundry time begins and is up, so you'll never forget to move your clothes to the dryer! 

I have started working out a solution just using an already existing list MongoDB database with a REST API, but I plan to migrate it to my own custom backend with time.

If nothing else I will have learnt a lot.

Wish me luck!

## A girl can dream features
* Notification system
* Installing hardware preventing anyone but the booker to enter the laundry room, preventing the most pressing issue of our time - laundry room time theft!
